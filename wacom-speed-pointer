Solution #2 (worked for me, Intuos S)
If xsetwacom doesn't work, another, probably better way to do it is by using xinput. First detect the id's of your tablet again, by executing:

xinput list | grep Wacom
You should now see a couple of id's, the most important are stylus and eraser. 
Then, find the attributes that set the constant deceleration, by executing this for as many device id's as you have (to exit press Ctrl+C):

xinput watch-props <device id>
You should see something like this in there:

Device Accel Constant Deceleration (284):   1.000000
The attribute's id is that number (in this case 284) at the end of the name. 
Now in order to slow down the tablet movement, increase this number by executing:

xinput set-prop <device id> <attribute id> <deceleration factor>
An example:

xinput set-prop 13 284 2.5 && xinput set-prop 15 284 2.5
In this case, my stylus movement was device id 13 and my eraser id 15 so I set them both to 2.5, 
which as far as I could tell about halved the movement speed.

Again, these settings aren't saved at shutdown, so the best way is to have these settings be applied every time you boot. 
There are many ways to accomplish this, but an exapmle would be adding this command to you .xinitrc in your home folder. 
If this doesn't work, look for another way to have a command executed at boot on the internet.

O comando "xinput set-prop 10 285 3" funcionou bem da ultima vez mas é necessário conferir se o ID (10, neste caso) não muda a cada reboot
