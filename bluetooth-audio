I'm on Ubuntu gnome 16.04. Solution is to enable auto-detection, pair the headset again and select it in the list of output audio devices.

1 - Change #AutoEnable=false to AutoEnable=true in the  /etc/bluetooth/main.conf (notice new line is un-commented)
2 - Unpair the headset
3 - Restart the bluetooth service sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
4 - Pair your headset again and connect it
5 - Go to sound settings. From the output device tab you should now see the headset listed along with other output device like internal speakers
6 - Choose it as the sound output device.
